Metadata cheat sheet
HTML <meta> tags 
Earlier in the course, you learned about meta tags and how you can leverage them to convey information to search engines to better categorize your pages. We recommend that you keep this cheat sheet handy when building your web applications. The structure of a meta tag is as follows.

Name 
The name of the property can be anything you like, although browsers usually expect a value they understand and can take an action upon. An example would be <meta name="author" content="name"> to state the author of the page. 

Content 

The content field specifies the property's value. For example, you can use <meta name="language" content="english">, to specify the language of the webpage to search engines. 

Charset 

The charset is a special field that lets you specify the character encoding used for the page so that the browser can display it properly. The most frequently used is utf-8, and you would add it to your HTML header as follows: <meta charset="UTF-8">  

HTTP-equiv 

This field stands for HTTP equivalent, and it’s used to simulate HTTP response headers. This is rare to see, and it’s recommended to use HTTP headers over HTML http-equiv meta tags. For example, the next tag would instruct the browser to refresh the page every 30 minutes: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">
